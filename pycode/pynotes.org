* Iterator Protocol
  This interface is most of what we call the iteration protocol in Python. Any
  object with a __next__method to advance to next result, which raised
  StopIteration at the end of the series of results is considered an iterator in
  python. All iteration tools like for, list comprehensions, map  normally work
  internally by calling __next__ method on each iteration and catching the
  StopIteration exception to determine when to exit. For some object an
  additional step to call *iter* is required.
  *We can turn iterable like list into iterator using iter function.*
  Dictionary are iterables. Iteration protocol converts dictionary iterable to
  an iterator which can give us the keys.
