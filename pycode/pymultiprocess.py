# Commentory
# Multiprocessing is module that supports spawning processes using an API
# similar to threading moudle. The multiprocessing package offers both local
# and remote concurrency, effectively sidestepping GIL by using subprocesses
# instead of threads. Due to this, the multiprocessing module allows the
# programmer to fully leverage multiple processors on a given machine.
